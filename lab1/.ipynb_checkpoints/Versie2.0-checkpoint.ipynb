    "# Lab 1: Text Corpora and Language Modelling\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the first lab assignment of INFOMNLP 2021. \n",
    "\n",
    "This lab is meant to help you get familiar with some language data, and use this data to estimate simple models called N-gram language models.\n",
    "\n",
    "First you will use the **Penn Treebank**, which is a collection of newspaper articles from the newspaper \n",
    "The Wall Street Journal. The idea is to examine the data and notice interesting properties. This will not take more than a few lines of code. The Penn Treebank may be the most widely used corpus in NLP.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then you will use a corpus consisting of **TedX** talks. This you will use to estimate an **N-gram language model** for different orders of N, and use this for some tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "The datasets are on Blackboard. Download them and make sure to put the files in the same directory as the notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rules\n",
    "* The lab exercises should be made in **groups of two people**.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The assignment should submitted to **Blackboard** as `.ipynb`. Only **one submission per group**.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The **filename** should be `lab1_id1_id2.ipynb`.\n",
    " \n",
    "* The questions marked **Extra** or **Optional** are an additional challenge for those interested in going the extra mile. \n",
    "\n",
    "* We may not grade all sub-questions (instead, we may choose a sub-set and scale the points). However, solve them as if they were.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notes on implementation:\n",
    "\n",
    "* You should **write your code and answers in this iPython Notebook**. (See http://ipython.org/notebook.html for reference material.) If you have problems, please contact your teaching assistant.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use only **one cell for code** and **one cell for markdown** answers!    \n",
    "\n",
    "    * Put all code in the cell with the `# YOUR CODE HERE` comment.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    * For theoretical questions, put your solution in the YOUR ANSWER HERE cell.\n",
    "    \n",
    "* Test your code and **make sure we can run your notebook**"

    "## Exercise 1.1 \n",
    "(40 points, 5 points per subquestion )\n",
    "\n",
    "You are provided with a corpus containing words with their Part-of-Speech tags (POS-tags for short). The format is\n",
    "**word|POS** (one sentence per line) and the file name is **sec02-22.gold.tagged**. This data is extracted from Sections 02-22 from the Penn Treebank: these sections are most commonly used for training statistical models like POS-taggers and parsers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The questions below are about both the words in the corpus and POS tags. POS-tagging will be covered in week2 in the course, but you can already start to get familiar with the tags in English.\n",
    "\n",
    "**[Hint]** **Figure 8.2** in chapter 8 of Jurafsky and Martin (see (https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/8.pdf)) holds a summary of the 45 POS-tags used in the Penn Treebank tagset together with their meaning and some examples. (If you are keen on learning more about the word-classes represented POS-tags and their definitions you can do a litle reading ahead for next week and already have a look at section 8.1 of the same chapter).\n",
    "\n",
    "**[Hint]** the Python library [collections](https://docs.python.org/2/library/collections.html) has an object called `Counter` which will come in handy for this exercise."

    "**Perplexity** is a frequently used **metric** for evaluating probabilistic models such as language models. The perplexity (sometimes called **PP** for short) of a language model on a sentence is the **inverse probability** of the sentence, **normalized** by the number of words:\n",

    "Here we can again approximate $P(w_1 \\dots w_n)$ with N-gram probabilities, as above.\n",
    "Note: $(x_1\\cdots x_n)^{-\\frac{1}{n}}$ is the **geometric mean** of the numbers $x_1,\\dots,x_n$. It is like the (regular) artithmetic mean, but with **products** instead of **sums**. The geometric mean is a more natural choice in the case of *PP* because behind $P(w_1\\dots w_n)$ is a series of $n$ products ([more here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_mean)).\n",

    "Congratulations, you have made it to the end of the tutorial. Here we will recap the gist of this notebook. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Make sure all your cells can be executed and all your answers are there. Then, read on if you're interested!**\n",
    "\n",
    "-----\n",
    "\n",
    "By now you should have a solid feeling for the problem of **sparsity in language data**; there's just never enough data. For the task of language modelling, we saw that sparsity is a serious challenge. \n",
    "\n",
    "It would be great to be able to model $p(w_n|w_1 \\dots w_{n-1})$ for unlimited $n$: the larger $n$ the better our language model should become at capturing the long-range dependencies between words that characterize actual human sentences, and the more probability our model will asign to such sentences as opposed to sentences that are word-soup. But in the N-gram approach, increasing $n$ will quickly kill all generalizing abilities of the model: the model will start to asign probabilities only to sentences it has seen in the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, where to go from here? Here are three directions that we could head in.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Smoothing\n",
    "\n",
    "We have seen one example of smoothing in this lab: add-k smoothing. This is an easy method, both conceptually and implementation-wise. But the results are not great, and the effects it has on the distributions can be extreme.\n",
    "\n",
    "A much more sophisticated method of smoothing is so-called **Kneser-Ney smoothing**. The method is described in detail in section 4.5 of J&M (3rd edition). This is one of the best performing N-gram smoothing methods, and up to a few years ago a popular implementation of it called [KenLM](https://kheafield.com/code/kenlm/) gave state of the art results.\n",
    "\n",
    "### From words to characters\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab we have considered language modeling as the task of predicting a **word** $w_n$ based on a history of **words** $w_1\\cdots w_n$. What if instead we let our basic units of modelling be **characters**? The task then becomes to model $p(c_k\\mid c_{k-N-1}\\dots c_{k-1})$ where each $c_i$ is now an ASCII character instead of an entire word.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suddenly sparsity of data is no longer a problem! The set of characters to use is tiny (< 100) compared to even a small-sized vocabulary as today. Have a look at this very illustrative notebook written by Yoav Golberg to see such a method in action: [The unreasonable effectiveness of Character-level Language Models](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/gist/yoavg/d76121dfde2618422139).\n",
    "\n",
    "(So what is the downside?)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Neural language models\n",
    "\n",
    "The above notebook was actually written as a response to this blog post by Andrej Karpathy: [The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Recurrent Neural Networks](http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/). Go ahead and read it if you haven't already: it is a superb introduction to the topic of Recurrent Neural Networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Neural language models solve the problem of data sparsity in a different manner. Instead of estimating the probabilities $p(w_k\\mid w_{k-N-1}\\dots w_{k-1})$ by counting occurences in the data, they use a neural network $f_{\\theta}$ parametrized by parameters $\\theta$ to predict this probability. The parameters $\\theta$ are learned through optimization. \n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest approach goes like this: each word in the history $w_{k-N-1}\\dots w_{k-1}$ is embedded separately giving  vectors $e_{k-N-1}\\dots e_{k-1}$ and then concatenated into one long vectors $[e_{k-N-1};\\dots ;e_{k-1}]$. The network then uses this history vector to predict a probability distribution over words $w$ in the vocabulary $V$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$p(w \\mid w_{k-N-1}\\dots w_{k-1}) = f_{\\theta}([e_{k-N-1};\\dots;e_{k-1}]).$$\n",
    "\n",
    "(In order to produce legitimate probabilities the final layer of such a network will be for example a $softmax$.)\n",
    "\n",
    "This provides a solution to the sparsity problem by having the network let the individual embeddings of the words in the history interact through its non-linear transforamtion. We are letting the network figure out the smoothing itself!\n",
    "\n",
    "RNNs are a clever extension of this idea, where a hidden state vector $h$ is re-used and updated at each step $k$ in order to store the information of the entire history up to step $k-1$. That is, an RNN actually does away with the N-order approximation; it tries to model the full conditional directly! That means that\n",
    "\n",
    "$$p(w \\mid w_1\\dots w_{k-1}) \\approx RNN_{\\theta}([e_{k-1};h_{k-1}])$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where the hidden state $h_{k-1}$ is a compression of the *entire history* $w_1\\dots w_{k-1}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another great place to learn about RNNs, their problems, and solutions to those, is on the blog of [Christopher Olah](http://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/). \n",
    "\n",
